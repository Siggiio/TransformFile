the very first VarInt is the xfr version

each command is identified by a VarInt, followed by it's data
string lengths are indicated by a VarInt prefix

After end of commands, non redundant data follows.
When a data chunk refers to file 0, it is referring to this section.

After non redundant data, the address index offset follows.
Each index position represents a 131072 byte size chunk, and points to
the start of the first data chunk plus the address of the end of the
offsets packet. Each index entry is an 8 byte big endian value, not a
VarInt, to allow for random seeking.

0 - end of commands

1 - file list
  VarInt filecount
  list of [filecount] Strings

  the first file in the list is at index 1
  index 0 refers to the xfr itself

2 - data chunk (must be followed by data chunk, close file, or end)
  VarInt transformedOffset
  VarInt fileIndex
  VarInt offset
  VarInt length

  if fileIndex is 0 (meaning referring to the xfr file itself)
  then when seeking, add the offset of the end of the 0 command

3 - file name
  String name

4 - parent directory levels to scan
  VarInt max number of levels to scan

5 - close file (must be followed by data chunk, close file, or end)
  VarInt the index of the file to close (the first file in the list is at index 1

6 - offsets (must be followed by data chunk, close file, or end)
  VarInt non redundant offset, from end of the offsets packet
  VarInt address index offset, from end of the offsets packet
  VarInt size of output file
